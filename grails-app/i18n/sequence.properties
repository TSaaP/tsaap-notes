sequence.interaction.executionContext.faceToFace.notice=\
The "<strong>Face to face</strong>" context corresponds to a pedagogical situation taking place in class or in amphitheater.<br/>\
The teacher controls the start of the sequence and then the transition to the next phases.<br/>\
Learners should complete each phase in the dedicated time and wait until the next phase opens.
sequence.interaction.executionContext.distance.notice=\
The "<strong>Distance</strong>" context corresponds to a pedagogical situation for which learners are in a situation of autonomy.<br/>\
The teacher controls only the opening and closing of the sequence.<br/>\
Each learner has the opportunity to do one phase after the other at his own pace, and then immediately discover the results.
sequence.interaction.executionContext.blended.notice=\
The "<strong>Hybrid</strong>" context corresponds to a pedagogical situation taking place at a distance followed by a presentation of the results in face-to-face.<br/>\
The teacher controls the opening of the sequence and the publication of the results.<br/>\
Learners can follow the first two phases at their own pace, but will not discover the results until they are published.

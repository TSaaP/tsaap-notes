Once your assignment has been created, you can add as many questions as you want. TsaaP-Notes includes:

1. single choice questions,
2. multiple-choice questions,
3. open-ended question.

For open-ended questions, students have to give a textual rationale for their answer. This rationale will be reviewed by peers — other students — after it has been submitted. As a consequence, every student has to review other contributions.

For single and multiple choice question, you can choose either if students have to give an explanation or not. If students give an explanation, it will be reviewed by peers — other students — after it has been submitted. As a consequence, every student has to review other contributions. In this reviewing phase, students can also choose to change their vote.

## 1. Select your assignment

In the **Assignments** menu, choose the assignment where you want to add a new question.

## 3. Single and multiple-choice questions

### 3.1. Title and Statement

Here is an example of a title and a statement. **Answer choices** have to be specified in the Statement field. Student choices of answers will be made using **numerical values** (1, 2, 3, …) so you have to specify a value for each choice — for instance by using numbered list ![Ordered list button]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/OrderedListButton.png).
